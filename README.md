# Map Generation using Deep Learning
1.I have learnt:
  1. Python programming language from the book "Automate the boring stuff with python"
  2. Machine Learning course from Stanford university through Coursera(by Andrew NG)


2.Implemented Linear Regression algorithm to find the line of best fit for a given sample of points.

3.Trained a model to classify handwritten digits whose images are 8 X 8 pixels.

4.Trained a model to classify handwritten digits whose images are 28 X 28 pixels.

5.Implemented GAN on MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
